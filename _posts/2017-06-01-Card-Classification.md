## EECS 349 Machine Learning Project

Group Members: [Yuchen Rao], [Weiyuan Deng]

## Overview
The goal for this project was to explore different machine learning techniques, such as Convolution Neural Net (CNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and apply them to an object recognition problem, such as identifying playing cards.

In-depth details about the project can be found on the project website [here](https://yuchenrao.github.io/EECS349-Card-Classification-Project/), with the source code and training data found [here](https://github.com/yuchenrao/EECS349-Card-Classification-Project). Below is a short video of the project.
